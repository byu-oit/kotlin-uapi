# Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through creating an API that is compatible with the University API Standard, using the
BYU UAPI Kotlin Runtime.

The API we will be creating represents a small public library.  The library only has books, as it is run by members
of the Most Pure and Undefiled Order of Librarians.

The code for each step of the tutorial can be viewed [on GitHub](https://github.com/byu-oit/kotlin-uapi/tree/master/examples/library/tutorial-steps).

TODO: Describe the library application.
