# Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through creating an API that is compatible with the University API Standard, using the
BYU UAPI Kotlin Runtime.

The API we will be creating represents a small public library.  The library only has books, as it is run by members
of the Most Pure and Undefiled Order of Librarians.

TODO: Describe the library application.
