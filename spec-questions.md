# Questions/Suggestions for the spec

- [ ] Define standard data types (JSON scalar types + things like date, date-time, etc.)
    - Probably just copy OpenAPI, but it would be nice to be explicit
- [ ] HTTP PATCH support? (very long-term)
- [ ] Correct response code for "You are authorized to do this, but the business logic says this can't happen right now"
- [ ] Add data sensitivity to response metadata
- [ ] Add deprecated metadata field?
- [ ] How to handle invalid GET query params?
